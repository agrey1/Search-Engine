This project for AC32007 Assignment 2 aims to produce a scenario in which full text-search with Solr can be effectively demonstrated.

The project includes a website crawling bot which visits a page, collects the links from that page and saves the list of words found on that page. We can then perform a full-text search of this information to produce a fairly effective internet serach engine.

An example of the project running with approximately 3GB of text from over 63,000 websites can be found at http://51.254.181.89:8080/
